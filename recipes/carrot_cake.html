            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped walnuts (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>For the frosting:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>4 ounces cream cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets or line with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Beat butter, brown sugar, and white sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth.</li>
            <li>Beat in eggs, one at a time, until combined. Stir in the crushed pineapple, carrots, and raisins.</li>
            <li>Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon; stir into carrot mixture. Fold in 3/4 cup walnuts if using.</li>
            <li>Drop spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tops are set, about 14 to 16 minutes. Allow cookies to cool for 2 minutes on the cookie sheets before removing to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Make the cream cheese frosting: Beat cream cheese, butter, and vanilla with an electric mixer on medium speed in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in powdered sugar gradually to reach spreading consistency.</li>
            <li>Frost cooled cookies with cream cheese frosting; sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup walnuts, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
